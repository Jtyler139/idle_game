# Idle Trash

## What is Idle Trash?

Idle trash is a pygame version of a click based adventure. Currently only the first encounter exists in a very rudimentary manner. The idea of the game is to click on the enemy to deal damage to the enemy health bar. After a period of time, if the health bar is not fully drained, the enemy will reset and you must begin again. Eventually I may add more levels or flesh out the encounter. I have ideas for powering up how much damage a click can do at a time, and for subsequent levels scaling the health of the enemy. However, seeing as this project's purpose was to get more comfortable developing an idea into a workable program, I am comfortable walking away from the current state of the project to focus on progressing deeper into Boot.dev
